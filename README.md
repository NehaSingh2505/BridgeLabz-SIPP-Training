Solving the scenario based problem:

 [IceCreamRush.java](https://github.com/NehaSingh2505/BridgeLabz-SIPP-Training/blob/dsa/ScenarioBased/IceCreamRush.java) 
 
##### Logic:
- I used two parallel arrays — one for the ice cream flavors and one for their corresponding sales numbers. During sorting, whenever I swapped two sales values, I also swapped their matching flavor names to keep both arrays in sync. This ensures the flavor list correctly reflects the sorted sales order.
