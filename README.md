# 🚀 BridgeLabz SIPP Training Repository

Welcome to my BridgeLabz Summer Internship and Placement Preparation (SIPP) Training repository. This repository contains my learnings, assignments, and code implementations across multiple topics in Computer Science and Java.

---

##  Branch Names & Descriptions

- **Core-Java**  
  Covers fundamental Java concepts including syntax, control structures, arrays, strings, and basic object-oriented programming.

- **OOPS**  
  Focuses on Object-Oriented Programming principles such as inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction, polymorphism, interfaces, and method overriding/overloading.

- **DSA-Java**  
  Contains data structures and algorithms implemented in Java. Covers arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, sorting, searching, etc.

- **Workshop**
 Contains mini projects that basically focuses on understanding the concept and implementing it .This include the following mini projects :
- library management system
- Vehicle rental system
- Online BillingSystem
- Vehicle parking sytem
- vowel consonant count program
