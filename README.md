Solving the scenario based problem:

 [IceCreamRush.java](https://github.com/NehaSingh2505/BridgeLabz-SIPP-Training/blob/dsa/ScenarioBased/IceCreamRush.java) 

##### Logic:
- I used two parallel arrays — one for the ice cream flavors and one for their corresponding sales numbers. During sorting, whenever I swapped two sales values, I also swapped their matching flavor names to keep both arrays in sync. This ensures the flavor list correctly reflects the sorted sales order.

[FoodFest.java](https://github.com/NehaSingh2505/BridgeLabz-SIPP-Training/blob/dsa/ScenarioBased/FoodFest.java)
 
##### Logic :
- I have implemented a program to merge two already sorted arrays 'stall1' and 'stall2' representing the footfall at two food stalls during a festival.
- I used a classic two-pointer technique to efficiently merge two sorted arrays (stall1 and stall2) into a single sorted array 
 without using any sorting after merging.
